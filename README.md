# Connecto-api
Tried to improve the blood donation community. It is a social media back-end app using express, with authentication, follow, like, comment, and sharing post features.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
### `git clone this-repo-url`
It will download all the files from this repository.
### `npm i`
It will install the rest of the files and installations.

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:8800](http://localhost:8800) to view it in your browser or postman.


### Database Configuration
I used MySQL as my database management system. I have attached the SQL file with the repository's root directory. Download and import it to your `XAMPP` or any other application.
